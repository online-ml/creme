# 0.21.0 - 2023-12-04

- The `learn_one` and `learn_many` methods of each estimator don't not return anything anymore. This is to emphasize that the estimators are stateful.
- The `update` and `revert` method of classes that have also cease to return anything.
- `sample_weight` has been renamed to `w`.

## covariance

- Fixed an issue where `update_many` would reset `covariance.EmpiricalCovariance` each time it was called.

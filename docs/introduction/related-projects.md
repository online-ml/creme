- [river-extra](https://github.com/online-ml/river-extra) regroups experimental features which have yet to prove themselves to make it into the main River repository. Between us we call this "the arena".
- [Beaver](https://github.com/online-ml/beaver) is an MLOps tool for covering the whole lifecycle of online machine learning models.

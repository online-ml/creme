# Installation

River is meant to work with Python 3.8 and above. Installation can be done via `pip`:

```sh
pip install river
```

You can install the latest development version from GitHub, as so:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/online-ml/river --upgrade
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/online-ml/river.git --upgrade  # using SSH
```

This method requires having Cython and Rust installed on your machine.

Feel welcome to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/online-ml/river/issues/new) if you are having any trouble.

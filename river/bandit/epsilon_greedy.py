class EpsilonGreedy(bandit.base.Policy):
    r"""$\eps$-greedy bandit policy.

    Performs arm selection by using an $\eps$-greedy bandit strategy. An arm is selected at each
    step. The best arm is selected (1 - $\eps$%) of the time.

    Selection bias is a common problem when using bandits. This bias can be mitigated by using
    burn-in phase. Each model is given the chance to learn during the first `burn_in` steps.

    Parameters
    ----------
    epsilon
        The probability of exploring.
    decay
        The decay rate of epsilon.
    reward_obj
        The reward object used to measure the performance of each arm. This can be a metric, a
        statistic, or a distribution.
    burn_in
        The number of steps to use for the burn-in phase. Each arm is given the chance to be pulled
        during the burn-in phase. This is useful to mitigate selection bias.
    seed
        Random number generator seed for reproducibility.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> import gym
    >>> from river import bandit
    >>> from river import stats

    >>> env = gym.make(
    ...     'river_bandits/CandyCaneContest-v0'
    ... )
    >>> _ = env.reset(seed=42)
    >>> _ = env.action_space.seed(123)

    >>> policy = bandit.EpsilonGreedy(epsilon=0.9, seed=101)

    >>> metric = stats.Sum()
    >>> while True:
    ...     action = next(policy.pull(range(env.action_space.n)))
    ...     observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    ...     policy = policy.update(action, reward)
    ...     metric = metric.update(reward)
    ...     if terminated or truncated:
    ...         break

    >>> metric
    Sum: 712.

class WebTraffic(base.RemoteDataset):
    """Web sessions information from an events company based in South Africa.

    The goal is to predict the number of web sessions in 4 different regions in South Africa.

    The data consists of 15 minute interval traffic values between '2023-06-16 00:00:00' and '2023-09-15 23:45:00' for each region. 
    Two types of sessions are captured `sessionsA` and `sessionsB`. The `isMissing` flag is equal to 1 if any of the servers failed 
    to capture sessions, otherwise if all servers functioned properly this flag is equal to 0. Things to consider:

    * region `R5` captures sessions in backup mode. Strictly speaking, `R5` is not necessary to predict.
    * Can `sessionsA` and `sessionsB` events be predicted accurately for each region over the next day (next 96 intervals)? 
    * What is the best way to deal with the missing values?
    * How can model selection be used (a multi-model approach)?
    * Can dependence (correlation) between regions be utilised for more accurate predictions?
    * Can both `sessionA` and `sessionB` be predicted simultaneously with one model?

    This dataset is well suited for time series forecasting models, as well as anomaly detection
    methods. Ideally, the goal is to build a time series forecasting model that is robust to the
    anomalous events and generalise well on normal operating conditions.

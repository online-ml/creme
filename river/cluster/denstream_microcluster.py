    """Micro cluster

    A micro cluster at time `t` for a group of closed points `p_{i_1}, p_{i_2}, ..., p_{i_n}}
    with time stamps `T_{i_1},  T_{i_2}, ..., T_{i_n}` is defined as ${\bar{CF^1}, \bar{CF^2}, \omega}$ [1]_.
        * $\omega = \sum_{j=1}^n f(t - T_{i_j})$ is the weight;
        * $\beta$ is the parameter to determine the threshold of outlier relative to micro clusters;
        * $\bar{CF^1} = \sum_{j=1}^n f(t - T_{i_j}) p_{i_j}$ is the weighted sum of the points;
        * $\bar{CF^2} = \sum_{j=1}^n f(t - T_{i_j}) p^2_{i_j}$ is the weighted squared sum of the points.

    Besides, in order to serve the purpose of calculating the metrics, we also save two other information: the (unweighted)
    linear sum (LS) and the (unweighted) squared sum (SS)
        * $LS = \sum_{j = 1}^n p_{i_j}$
        * $SS = \sum_{j = 1}^n p^2_{i_j}$

    The center of the micro cluster is

    $$
    c = \frac{\bar{CF^1}}{\omega},
    $$

    while the radius of the micro cluster is

    $$
    r = \sqrt{\frac{|\bar{CF^2}|}{\omega} - \left( \frac{|\bar{CF^1}|}{\omega} \right)^2}
    $$

    In order to maintain all the information incrementally, we proceed to calculate the parameters
    (weight, weighted linear sum and weighted squared sum) at the initial state, i.e at the time `t = 0`.
    When the `current_time` parameter is passed, all the parameters will be calculated by simply multiplying
    $f(t)$ to the initial values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x
        The initial point that is added to the micro cluster

    timestamp
        The timestamp that `x` is created and added to the micro cluster

    decaying_factor
        The decaying factor defined by the user

    current_time
        Current time that the micro cluster is called. At the beginning, when the cluster is created,
        `current_time` is equal to `timestamp`, the time stamp of the first point in the cluster.

    Attributes
    ----------
    N
        number of points in the micro cluster

    dim
        The dimension of the points in the cluster, which is equal to the number of attributes in each point.

    creation_time
        The time point that the micro cluster is created.
        It is equal to the timestamp of the first element of the micro cluster.
